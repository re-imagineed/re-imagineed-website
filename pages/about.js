We use results as self-reflective tools for our improvement, and we ground our performance and decision-making in data. Data helps us to both frame our challenges and eliminate barriers that get in the way of operating simply, quickly and effectively. Excellence is always the goal, and good is the enemy of great."},

These identity categories are both visible and invisible, including but not limited to race, ethnicity, gender, age, national origin, religion, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, socioeconomic status, education, marital status, and language. We also recognize that individuals are affiliated with multiple identities, both seen and unseen, and experience those identities differently."},

Equity is not a one-size-fits-all model, and is not about being difference-blind, but rather about actively engaging with difference and eliminating barriers to opportunity."},

An inclusive and welcoming climate embraces differences and offers respect in words and actions for all people, allowing everyone to bring their full, authentic selves to their work."},
